        <h2>Box Pleated Curtains</h2>
        <p><b>Box pleated curtains give a very tailored look and drape into deep folds down the full length of the curtains. The box shapes line up next to each other which creates that formal, pleated look. They are ideal for more formal rooms like the lounge, dining or study.</b></p>

        <h2>Cased Heading Curtains</h2>
        <p><b>A simple cased heading is used mainly for nets and lightweight fabrics that are not to be opened and closed frequently. A casing sewn across the top is left open at the ends. These need to be hung on a slender curtain rod that threads through the channel and fits onto hooks or into sockets at the sides of the window.</b></p>

        <h2>Eyelet Curtains</h2>
        <p><b>Eyelet curtains are ideal for light to medium weight fabrics and include silver rings at the header that a rod weaves through. The curtains hang easily and freely making this style ideal for kids bedrooms as they are easy to open, close and maintain. When made with a more formal fabric eyelet curtains are a great option for a modern bedroom or lounge room as their no fuss design is very contemporary.</b></p>
